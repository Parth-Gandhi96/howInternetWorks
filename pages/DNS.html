                    <h1>DNS - Domain Name System</h1>
                    <div class="mt-4"></div>
                    <p>To access the internet we always use domain names instead of the complex IP address numbers.
                        From where does the internet get IP addresses corresponding to our domain name requests.
                        Well, for this purpose the internet uses a huge phone book known as DNS.</p>

                    <h4>How does DNS work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you know a person's name, but don't know their telephone number
                        you can simply look it up in a phone book.
                        The DNS server provides the same service to the internet.
                        Your internet service provider or other organizations can manage the DNS server.
                        Let's have a recap of the whole operation.
                        You enter the domain name,
                        the browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the corresponding IP address.
                        After getting the IP address,
                        your browser simply forwards the request to the data center,
                        more specifically to the respective server.
                        Once the server gets a request to access a particular website the data flow starts.
                        The data is transferred in digital format via optical fiber cables,
                        more specifically in the form of light pulses.
                        These light pulses sometimes have
                        to travel thousands of miles via the optical fiber cable to reach their destination.
                        During their journey they often have to go through tough terrains
                        such as hilly areas or under the sea.
                        There are a few global companies who lay
                        and maintain these optical cable networks.
                        These visuals show how the laying of optical fiber cables is done with the help of a ship.
                        A plow is dropped deep into the sea from the ship,
                        and this plow creates a trench on the seabed and to which places the optical fiber cable.
                        In fact, this complex optical cable
                        network is the backbone of the Internet.
                        These optical fiber cables carrying the
                        light are stretched across the seabed to your doorstep where they are connected to a router.
                        The router converts these light signals
                        to electrical signals.
                        An Ethernet cable is then used to
                        transmit the electrical signals to your laptop.
                        However if you are accessing the Internet using cellular data,
                        from the optical cable the signal has to be sent to a cell tower
                        and from the cell tower the signal
                        reaches your cell phone in the form of electromagnetic waves.
                        Since the Internet is a global network it has become important to have an
                        organization to manage things like IP address assignment, domain name registration etc
                        this is all managed by an institution called ICANN located in the USA.
                        One amazing thing about the internet is its efficiency in
                        transmitting data when compared with cellular and landline communication technologies.</p>
