                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every device that is connected to the Internet
                        whether it is a server a computer or a mobile phone is identified uniquely by a
                        string of numbers known as an IP address.
                        You can consider the IP address similar
                        to your home address that is the address, that uniquely identifies your home.
                        Any letter sent to you reaches you precisely because of your home address.
                        Similarly in the internet world an IP address acts as a shipping address
                        through which all information reaches its destination.
                        Your internet service provider will decide the IP address of your device and you are able to see
                        what
                        IP address your ISP has given to your mobile phone or laptop.
                        The server in the data center also has an IP address.
                        The server stores a website so you can access any website just by knowing the
                        server's IP address. However, it is difficult for a person to remember so
                        many IP addresses.
                        So to solve this problem domain names like
                        youtube.com, facebook.com etc are used which correspond to IP addresses
                        which are easier for us to remember than the long sequence of numbers
                        Another thing to notice here is that a server has the capability of storing several websites
                        and if the server consists of multiple websites all the websites cannot be
                        accessed with the server's IP address.
                        In such cases additional pieces of
                        information, host headers are used to uniquely identify the website.
                        However, for the giant web sites like Facebook.com or YouTube.com the entire data
                        center infrastructure will be dedicated to the storage of the particular website.
                        To access the internet we always use domain names instead of the complex IP address numbers.
                        From where does the internet get IP addresses corresponding to our domain name requests.
                        Well, for this purpose the internet uses a huge phone book known as DNS.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Concept of IP Addresses</h4>
                    <p>
                        The work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn invented the internet working protocol, to make communication
                        possible.
                        This invention laid the groundwork for what we now call the internet.
                        The internet is a network of networks. It links billions of devices together all
                        around the globe. So maybe you're connected with a laptop or a phone through wifi, then
                        that wifi connection connects to an internet service provider (or ISP), and that ISP connects
                        you to billions and billions of devices around the world through hundreds of thousands of
                        networks that are all interconnected.
                        One thing that most people do not appreciate is that the internet is really a design philosophy
                        and an architecture expressed in a set of protocols.
                        A protocol is a well known set of rules and standards, that if all parties
                        agree to use it, will allow them to communicate without trouble.
                        How the internet actually physically works is less important than the fact that this design
                        philosophy
                        has allowed the internet to adapt and absorb new communication technologies.
                        This is because in order for a new technology to use the internet in some fashion, it just needs
                        to know which protocols to work with.
                        All the different devices on the internet have unique addresses.
                        An address on the internet is just a number, similar to a phone number or a sort of street
                        address,
                        that's unique to each computer or device at the edge of the network.
                        This is similar to how most homes and businesses have a mailing address. You don't need to know
                        a person to
                        send them a letter in the mail, but you do need to know their address and how to write
                        the address properly so the letter can be carried by a mail system to its destination.
                        The addressing system for computers on the internet is similar and it forms part of one
                        of the most important protocols used in internet communication simply called the internet
                        protocol or IP.
                        A computer's address then is called its IP address. Visiting a website is really
                        just your computer asking another computer for information. Your computer sends a message
                        to the other computer's IP address and it also sends along its origin address, so the
                        other computer knows where to send its response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IP is just numbers organized in a hierarchy.
                        Just like a home address has a country, a city, a street, and a house number,
                        an IP address has many parts.
                        Just like all digital data, each of these numbers is represented in bits.
                        Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long,
                        with 8 bits for each part of the address.
                        The earlier numbers usually identify the country and regional network of the device.
                        Then come the subnetworks, and then finally the address of the specific device.
                        This version of IP addressing is called IPv4.
                        It was designed in 1973 and was widely adopted in the early 80s,
                        and provides for more than 4 billion unique addresses for devices connecting to the Internet.
                        But the internet has turned out to be much more popular than even Vint Cerf imagined
                        and 4 billion unique addresses won't be enough.
                        We're now in the middle of a multi-year transition to a longer IP address format
                        called IPv6,
                        which uses 128 bits per address and provides over 340 undecillion unique addresses.
                        That's more than enough for every grain of sand on Earth to have its own IP address.
                        Most users never see or care about internet addresses.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How data is stored and get interpreted?</h4>
                    <p>This web content that you are reading from the Google Data Center is sent to
                        you in the form of a huge collection of zeros and ones.
                        What makes the data transfer in the internet efficient is the way in which these zeros and ones
                        are chopped up into small chunks known as packets and transmitted.
                        Let's assume these streams of zeros and ones are divided into different packets by the
                        server where each packet consists of six bits.
                        Along with the bits of the web content each packet also consists of the sequence
                        number and the IP addresses of the server and your phone.
                        With this information the packets are routed towards your phone.
                        It's not necessary that all packets are routed through the same path and each packet
                        independently
                        takes the best route available at that time.
                        Upon reaching your phone the packets are reassembled according to their sequence number.
                        If it is the case that any packets fail to reach your phone and acknowledgement
                        is sent from your phone to resend the lost packets.
                        Now compare this with a postal network
                        with a good infrastructure, but the customers do not follow the basic rules
                        regarding the destination addresses.
                        In this scenario letters won't be able to
                        reach the correct destination.
                        Similarly in the internet we use something called protocols for the
                        management of this complex flow of data packets.
                        The protocols set the rules for
                        data packet conversion, attachment of the source and destination addresses to each packet
                        and the rules for routers etc for different applications the protocols
                        used are different.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Internet: Wires, Cables & Wifi</h3>

                    <h4>How does a picture, text message or email gets sent from one place to another?</h4>
                    <p>It isn't magic. It's the Internet,
                        a tangible physical system that was made to move information.
                        The Internet is a lot like the postal service,
                        but the physical stuff that gets sent is a little bit different.
                        Instead of like boxes and envelopes the Internet ships binary information.
                        Information is made of bits.
                        A bit can be described as any pair of opposites -
                        "on" or "off".
                        "Yes" or "no".
                        We typically use a one meaning "on" or a zero meaning "off".
                        Because a bit has two possible states, we call it binary code.
                        Eight bits strung together makes one byte.
                        1000 bytes all together is a kilobyte.
                        1,000 kilobytes is a megabyte.
                        A song is typically encoded using about three to four megabytes.
                        It doesn't matter if it's a picture, a video or a song
                        everything on the Internet is represented and sent around as bits,
                        These are the atoms of information!
                        But it's not like we're physically sending ones and zeros from one place to another,
                        one person to another.</p>

                    <h4>What is the physical stuff that actually gets sent over the wires and the airwaves?</h4>
                    <p>We could turn on a light for a 1 or off for 0.
                        Or use beeps or similar sort of things of like Morse code.
                        These methods work but they're really slow, error-prone totally dependent upon humans .
                        What we really need is a machine.
                        So throughout history we've built many systems that can
                        actually send this binary information through different types of physical mediums.
                        Today we physically send bits by electricity, light and radio waves.
                        To send a bit via electricity, imagine that you have two light bulbs
                        connected by a copper wire.
                        If one device operator turns on the electricity then the light bulb lights up.
                        No electricity, no light.
                        If the operators on both ends agree that light on means one
                        and light off means zero then we have a system for sending bits
                        of information from one person to another using electricity.
                        But we have a problem.
                        Let's say that, y'know, we want to send five zeros in a row.
                        Well how can you do that in such a way that either person
                        can actually count the number of zeros?
                        Well the solution is to introduce a clock or a timer.
                        The operators can agree that the sender will send one bit per second
                        And the receiver will sit down and record every single second and see what's on the line.
                        To send five zeros in a row you just turn off the light...
                        wait five seconds...
                        the person on the other end of the line will write down all five seconds
                        say zero zero zero.
                        And for ones do the opposite - turn on the light.
                        Obviously we'd like to send things a little bit faster than one bit per second.
                        So we need to increase our bandwidth:
                        the maximum transmission capacity of a device.
                        Bandwidth is measured by bit rate,
                        which is the number of bits that we can actually send over a given period of time,
                        usually measured in seconds.
                        A different measure of speed is the latency
                        or the amount of time it takes for one bit to travel from one place to another,
                        from the source to the requesting device.
                        In our human analogy one bit per second was pretty fast
                        but kind of hard for a human to keep up with.
                        So let's say that you want to actually download a 3 megabyte song
                        in like three seconds.
                        At 8 million bits per megabyte
                        that means a bit rate of about 8 million bits per second.
                        Obviously humans can't send or receive 8 million bits per second.
                        But a machine can do that just fine.</p>

                    <h4>What sort of cable to send these messages over? And how far the signals can go?</h4>
                    <p>With an Ethernet wire, the kind that you find in your home or office or school,
                        you see really measurable signal loss over just a few hundred feet.
                        So if we really want this Internet thing to work over the entire world
                        we need a different way of sending this information really long distances.
                        I mean like across an ocean.
                        Well what do we know that moves a lot faster than just like electricity through a wire?...
                        light!
                        We can actually send bits as light beams from one place to another
                        using a fiber optic cable.
                        A fiber optic cable is a thread of glass engineered to reflect light.
                        When you send a beam of light down the cable
                        light bounces up and down the length of the cable until it is received on the other end.
                        Depending on the bounce angle we can actually send multiple bits simultaneously,
                        all of them traveling at the speed of light.
                        So fiber is really, really fast.
                        But more importantly the signal doesn't really degrade over long distances.
                        This is how you can go hundreds of miles without signal loss.
                        This is why we use fiber optic cables across the ocean floors
                        to connect one continent to another.
                        In 2008 there was a cable that was actually cut near Alexandria, Egypt,
                        which really interrupted the Internet for most of the Middle East and India.
                        So we take this Internet thing for granted but
                        it's really a pretty fragile physical system.
                        Fiber is awesome but it's also really expensive and hard to work with.
                        For most purposes you're gonna find copper cable.</p>

                    <h4>how do we move things without wires? How do we send things wirelessly?</h4>
                    <p>Wireless bit sending machines typically use a radio signal
                        to send bits from one place to another.
                        The machines have to actually translate the ones and zeros
                        into radio waves of different frequencies.
                        The receiving machines reverse the process and convert it
                        back into binary on your computer.
                        So wireless has made our Internet mobile but a radio signal doesn't travel all that far
                        before it completely gets garbled.
                        This is why you can't really pick up a Los Angeles radio station in Chicago.
                        As great as wireless is, today it still relies on the wired internet.
                        If you're in a coffee shop using Wi-Fi then the bits get sent
                        through this wireless router and then are transferred
                        to the physical wire to travel the really long distances of the Internet.
                        The physical method for sending bits may change in the future.
                        Whether it's lasers sent between satellites or radio waves from balloons or drones.
                        But the underlying binary representation of information and the protocols for sending that
                        information
                        and receiving that information have pretty much stayed the same.
                        Everything on the Internet
                        whether it's words, emails, images, cat videos, puppy videos...
                        all come down to these ones and zeros
                        being delivered by electronic pulses, light beams, radio waves etc.
