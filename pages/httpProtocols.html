                    <p>
                        Let's look at web browsing.
                        First, you open a web browser. It's the app you use to access the web pages.
                        Next, you type in the web address, or URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator of the
                        website
                        you want to visit like Tumblr.com.
                    </p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img class="rounded mt-3 mb-5"  src="../images/http.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        What actually happens when you type an address into your web browser and then hit enter?
                        And it really is about as crazy as you can imagine. So in that moment your
                        computer starts talking to another computer, called a server, that's usually thousands of miles
                        away.
                        And in milliseconds your computer asks that server for a website, and that server
                        starts to talk back to your computer in a language called HTTP.
                        And HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
                        You can kind of think of it as the language that one computer uses
                        to ask another computer for a document.
                        And it's actually really pretty straightforward.
                        If you were to intercept the conversation between your computer and a web server on
                        the internet, it's mainly made up of something called "GET" requests. Those are really very
                        simply the word GET and the name of the document that you're requesting. So if you try to log
                        into Tumblr and load our login page, all you're doing is sending a GET request to Tumblr's
                        server that says GET /login. And that tells Tumblr's server that you want all of the HTML
                        code for the Tumblr login page.
                        So HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and you can
                        think of that as the language you use to tell a web browser how to make a page look.
                        If you think about something like Wikipedia, which is really just a big simple document
                        and HTML is the language that you use to make that title big and bold,
                        to make the font the right font,
                        to link certain text to certain other pages, to make some text bold, to make some
                        to make some text bold, to make some text italic,
                        to put an image in the middle of the page, to align the image to the right,
                        to align the image to the left.
                        The text of a web page is included directly in the HTML,
                        but other parts, images or videos, are separate files with their own URLs that need to be
                        requested.
                        The browser sends separate HTTP requests for each of these and displays them as they arrive.
                        If a web page has a lot of different images, each of them causes a separate HTTP request
                        and the page loads slower.</p>
                    <p>
                        Now sometimes when you browse the web, you're not just requesting pages with GET requests.
                        Sometimes you send information like when you fill out a form or type a search query.
                        Your browser sends this information in plain text
                        to the web server using an HTTP POST request.
                        Let's say you log in to Tumblr.
                        Well the first thing you do is you make a POST request, that is a POST to Tumblr's login page
                        that has
                        some data attached to it. It has your email address, it has your password. That goes to
                        Tumblr's server. Tumblr's server figures out that okay, you're David. It sends a web page
                        back to your browser that
                    </p>

                    <h4>How is it possible for every piece of data to be delivered to you reliably?</h4>

                    <p>Assume you want to play a song from Spotify.
                        It seems like your computer connects directly to Spotify servers and Spotify sends you a song on
                        a
                        direct, dedicated line. But actually, that's not how the internet works.
                        If the internet were made of direct, dedicated connections,
                        it would be impossible to keep things working as millions of users join.
                        Especially since there is no guarantee that every wire and computer is working all the time.
                        Instead, data travels on the internet in a much less direct fashion.</p>

                    <p>The way information gets transferred from one computer to another is pretty interesting.
                        It need not follow a fixed path, in fact, your path may change
                        in the midst of a computer to computer conversation. Information on the internet goes from one
                        computer to another in what we call a packet of information
                        and a packet travels from one place to another on the Internet
                        a lot like how you might get from one place to another in a car.
                        Depending on traffic congestion or road conditions, you might choose or be
                        forced to take a different route to get to the same place each time you travel.</p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img class="rounded mt-3 mb-5"  src="../images/route_traffic.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>And just as you can transport all sorts of stuff inside a car,
                        many kinds of digital information can be sent with IP packets but there are some limits.
                        What if, for example, you need to move a space shuttle from where it was built to where it will
                        be launched?
                        The shuttle won't fit in one truck so it needs to be broken down into pieces, transported using
                        a fleet of trucks.
                        They could all take different routes and might get to the destination at different times.
                        But once all the pieces are there, you can reassemble the pieces into the complete shuttle
                        and it will be ready for launch.
                        On the internet, the details work similarly.
                        If you have a very large image that you want to send to a friend or upload to a website,
                        that image might be made up of 10s of millions of bits of 1s and 0s, too many to send along in
                        one packet.
                        Since it's data on a computer, the computer sending the image can quickly
                        break it into hundreds or even thousands of smaller parts called packets.
                        Unlike cars or trucks, these packets don't have drivers and they don't choose their route.
                        Each packet has the internet address of where it came from and where it's going.
                        Special computers on the internet called routers
                        act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving through the networks smoothly.
                        If one route is congested, individual packets may travel different routes through the internet
                        and they may arrive at the destination at slightly different times or even out of order.</p>

                    <p>As part of the internet protocol,
                        every router keeps track of multiple paths for sending packets, and it chooses the cheapest
                        available path for each piece of data based on destination IP address for the packet.
                        Cheapest in this case doesn't mean cost, but time and non-technical factors
                        such as politics and relationships between companies.
                        Often the best route for data to travel isn't necessarily the most direct.
                        Having options for paths makes the network fault tolerant.
                        Which means the network can keep sending packets even if something goes horribly, horribly
                        wrong.
                        This is the basis for a key principle of the internet: reliability.</p>

                    <p>Now, what if you want to request some data and not everything is delivered? Say you want to
                        listen to a song.
                        How can you be 100% sure all the data will be delivered so the song plays perfectly?
                        TCP comes into picture here - Transmission Control Protocol.
                        TCP manages the sending and receiving of all your data as packets. Think of it like a guaranteed
                        mail service.
                        When you request a song on your device, Spotify sends a song broken up into many packets.
                        When your packets arrive, TCP does a full inventory
                        and sends back acknowledgements of each packet received.
                        If all packets are there, TCP signs for your delivery and you're done.
                        If TCP finds some packets are missing, it won't sign, otherwise your
                        song won't sound as good or portions of the song could be missing.
                        For each missing or incomplete packet, Spotify will resend them.
                        Once TCP verifies the delivery of many packets
                        for that one song request, your song will start to play.</p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img class="rounded mt-3 mb-5"  src="../images/tcp.png">
                    </div>
                    <h4>What's great about the TCP and router systems is they're scalable.</h4>
                    <p>They can work with 8 or 8 billion devices.
                        In fact, because of these principles of fault tolerance and redundancy, the more routers we add,
                        the
                        more reliable the internet becomes.
                        What's also great is we can grow and scale the internet
                        without interrupting service for anybody using it.
                        The internet is made of hundreds of thousands of networks
                        and billions of computers and devices connected physically.
                        These different systems that make up the internet connect to each other,
                        communicate with each other,
                        and work together because of agreed upon standards for how data is sent around on the internet.
                        Computing devices, or routers along the internet, help all the packets make their way to the
                        destination where they're reassembled, if necessary, in order.
                        This happens billions of times a day, whether you and others are sending an email, visiting a
                        web page,
                        doing a video chat, using a mobile app,
                        or when sensors or devices on the internet talk to each other.</p>
