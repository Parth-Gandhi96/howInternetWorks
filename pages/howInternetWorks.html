                    <h4>What is the internet?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most people don't have any idea where the internet came from and
                        doesn't matter, they don't need to. It's sort of like asking who invented the
                        ballpoint pen, or the flush toilet or the zipper.
                        These are all things we just use every day we don't even think about the fact that one day
                        somebody invented them.
                        So the internet is just like that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many, many years ago in the early 1970s
                        It was a result of another experiment called the ARPANET
                        which stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network.
                        It was a Defense Department research project.
                        Paul Baran was trying to figure out how to build a
                        communication system that might actually survive a nuclear attack.
                        So he had this idea of breaking messages up into blocks and sending them as fast
                        as possible in every possible direction through the mesh network.
                        So we built what eventually became a nationwide experimental packet network,
                        and it worked.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Is anybody in charge of the internet?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The honest answer is well nobody and maybe another answer is everybody.
                        The real answer is that the internet is made up of an incredibly large number of
                        independently operated networks.
                        What's interesting about the system is that it's fully distributed. There's no
                        central control that is deciding how packets are routed or where pieces of the network are built
                        or even who interconnects with whom.
                        These are all business decisions that are made independently by the operators.
                        They are all motivated to assure that there is end-to-end connectivity of
                        every part of the network because the utility of the net is that any device
                        can communicate with any other device; just like you want to be able to make
                        phone calls to any other telephone in the world.
                        The idea that what you know might be useful to somebody else
                        or vice versa is a very powerful motivator
                        for sharing information.
                        By the way that's how science gets done, people share information.
                        So this is an opportunity for people to think up new applications,
                        maybe program them as apps on a mobile phone,
                        maybe become part of the continued growth of the infrastructure of the
                        network to bring it to people who don't have access to it yet; or just make use
                        of it on a day-to-day basis.
                        You can't escape from contact with the internet so why not get to know it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How does the internet work?</h4>
                    <p>The web-content you are reading now
                        traveled thousands of miles from a Google Data Center to reach you.
                        Let's learn how the internet works by getting to understand the details of this data's
                        incredible journey.
                        The data center which can be thousands of miles away from you has this content stored inside it.
                        how does this data reach your mobile phone or a laptop?
                        An easy way to achieve this goal would be with use of satellites.
                        From the data center, a signal could be sent to the satellite via an antenna,
                        and then from the satellite a signal could be sent to your mobile phone
                        via another antenna near to you.
                        However, this way of transmitting signals is not a good idea.
                        The satellite is parked nearly 22,000 miles above the earth's equator,
                        so in order for the data transmission to be successful,
                        the data would have to travel a total distance of 44,000 miles.
                        Such a long distance of travel causes a significant delay in receiving the signal.
                        More specifically it causes huge latency which is unacceptable
                        for most internet applications.</p>

                    <h4>How does the data actually get to you?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Well it is done with the help of a complicated
                        network of optical fiber cables,
                        which connect between the data center and your device.
                        Your phone could be connected to the internet via cellular data or any Wi-Fi router,
                        but ultimately at some point your phone will be connected
                        to this network of optical fiber cables
                        We saw at the beginning that the web content you are currently reading
                        is stored inside a data center.
                        To be more specific, it is stored in a solid-state device within the data center.
                        This SSD acts as the internal memory of a server.
                        The server is simply a powerful computer whose job is to provide you the data or
                        other stored content when you request it.
                        Now the challenge is how to transfer the data stored
                        in the data center specifically to your device via the
                        complex network of optical fiber cables.
